# Jaiabot Engineer and Debug

The JaiaBot Engineer & Debug is a utility application that allows engineers and developers to send low-level engineering commands directly to JaiaBots. Users can use this application to adjust motor and rudder values, initiate IMU calibration, perform echo testing, and conduct dives with specified throttle and rudder settings. The application receives data in real time and can be used for debugging purposes.
